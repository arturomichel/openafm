			<img ng-src="/images/nanotubes.jpg">
			<p>An <strong>A</strong>tomic <strong>F</strong>orce <strong>M</strong>icroscope is part of a large family of imaging techniques called scanning probe microscopy (SPM).</p>
			<p>Microscopes in this family differ from traditional microscopes in that they do not use lenses, light, and optics to create an image, instead they use a scanning stage and a probe to render an image.</p>
			<img ng-src="/images/ucm287849.png">
			<p>Using very precise scanning stages and very sensitive probes SPM's can "see" things much smaller things than traditional optical microscopes. In fact we can see molecules and even atoms.</p>
			<p>Atomic force microscopes use a very fine cantilever probe to sense the height of a sample at any give point by pushing against it, similar to the way braille is read.</p>

			<strong class="headline">What is OpenAFM?</strong><br/>
		 	<p><strong>OpenAFM</strong> is an initiative to create a low-cost open source <strong>a</strong>tomic <strong>f</strong>orce <strong>m</strong>icroscope.</p>
			<p>The projected originates from the Lego2Nano summer programme; an ongoing collaboration between University College London and Tsinghua University in Beijing.</p>
			<img ng-src="/images/img_3928.jpg">
			<p>A multi-disciplinary group of students are brought together to hack a low-cost alternative to scientific equipment for use in schools.</p>
			<p> We hope that in building low cost and open source versions of traditionally expensive and specialist scientific tools we will enable and empower high school students and individual enthusiasts to learn about scientific topics and participate, and even lead real scientific research.</p>

			<p>An atomic force microscope uses a precision stage to move the sample, an optical readout device, control electronics and software.</p>

			<p>Because an <strong>AFM</strong> operate at the nm scale the engineering challenges are considerable and building one will help you learn about the nano-world and how basic processes are impacted at this scale.<p>
