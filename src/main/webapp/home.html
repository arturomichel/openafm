			<strong class="headline">What is OpenAFM?</strong><br/>
		 	<p><strong>OpenAFM</strong> is an initiative to create a low-cost open source <strong>a</strong>tomic <strong>f</strong>orce <strong>m</strong>icroscope.</p>
			<p>The projected originates from the Lego2Nano summer programme; an ongoing collaboration between University College London and Tsinghua University in Beijing.</p>
			<p>A multi-disciplinary group of students are brought together to hack a low-cost alternative to scientific equipment for use in schools.</p>
			<p> We hope that in building low cost and open source versions of traditionally expensive and specialist scientific tools we will enable and empower high school students and individual enthusiasts to learn about scientific topics by participating in and even leading real scientific research.</p>

			<strong class="headline">What is an Atomic Force Microscope?</strong>
			<p>An <strong>AFM</strong> is a microscope part of a large family of techniques called scanning probe microscopy (SPM).</p>
			<p>Microscopes in this family differ from traditional microscopes in that they do not use lenses, light, and optics to create an image, instead they use a scanning stage and a probe to render an image.</p>
			<p>Using very precise scanning stages and very sensitive probes SPM's can "see" things much smaller things than traditional optical microscopes. In fact we can see molecules and even atoms.</p>
			<p>Atomic force microscopes use a very fine cantilever probe to sense the height of a sample at any give point by pushing against it, similar to the way braille is read.</p>
