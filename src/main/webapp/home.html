		<strong class="h3"	>OpenAFM</strong> is a project to build a
			low cost open source atomic force microscope (AFM). The projected
			originates from Lego2Nano, an ongoing collaboration between
			University College London and Tsinghua University in Beijing, in
			which PhD students are brought together to hack low-cost scientific
			equipment for use in Chinese schools. We hope that in building low
			cost and open source versions of traditionally expensive and
			specialist scientific tools we will enable and empower high school
			students and individual enthusiasts to learn abut scientific topics
			by participating in and even leading real scientific research.</div>

		<strong class="h3">What is an Atomic Force Microscope</strong>

An atomic force microscope is part of a large family of techniques 
called scanning probe microscopy (SPM). The difference between 
SPMs and traditional microscopes is that SPMs do not use a lens or 
optics to create an image, instead they use a scanning stage and a 
probe to build up an image. By using a very precise scanning stage 
and very sensitive probe SPM?s can see things much much smaller 
than a traditional microscope. In fact we can see molecules and even 
atoms. Atomic force micrscopes use a very fine cantilever probe to 
measure the height of a sample by pusing against it, similar to the 
way braile is read.</div>
